# t.photography

First react project built using the awesome [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

`npm install && npm start` and you're ready to go.

This is an ongoing project, you can track my progress [here](https://github.com/iamtimm/t.photography/projects/1).
